This is a mini project which create the 3D model by programming languages javascript and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), to create an intricate 3D model with interactive features. 

This project showcases my proficiency in computer visualization, graphics, and shader programming.

Design the lighting angle with physical real projection on the surface of ball from diff angels.

Key features:

- Lighting changes
- Dynamic angle projection
- Customize materials texture for the visualized balls
